Trace the full call path from the frontend form submission through the useQueries mutation hook to the backend addStaff (or equivalent) function in main.mo. Ensure the mutation correctly constructs the staff record payload (name, role, generated ID, active status), calls the actor method, handles the response, and invalidates the staff list query cache so the newly added member appears in the list immediately.",
