  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-11 by fixing the frontend mutation hook (renaming/correcting useAddStaff to call actor.addStaff correctly), updating StaffManagement.tsx to use the corrected hook with proper error handling, generating a staffId before calling the mutation, and invalidating the staff query cache on success. The backend addStaff function accepts staffId/fullName/role and returns Bool. Empty-name validation and duplicate/error toast handling are present. Deactivation and listing functionality appear intact.",
